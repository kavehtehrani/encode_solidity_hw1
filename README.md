### Interact with “HelloWorld.sol” within your group to change message strings and change owners

We deployed the contract using remix + metamask on Sepolia 
[here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xaed1a13edff1076318ff3a6aff548d750940d83e).

Contract creation tx is [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x2774f4dd6e6ec3c67b9d6bb3c7ba66a0a6ddd8f586e66e385f4e133ac5789ee1). 

### Write a report with each function execution and the transaction hash, if successful, or the revert reason, if failed
* We setText() for [first time](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xd6ff2361f774085f9262b33d71078f87696c6ebefb43fa657ca1e70d66902a31) to change from initial message set by the constructor. 
* Change it a 
[second time](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x61025dfbe057ce2c3394a5dddfb85a6829104864a11782498fdf1e9c88b355af).
* Transfer ownership to a 
[new address](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xdcef6a71a8213441882c7bfabfbc8769382ae9fcb4f5c7e969dec8ee43649df2). Also see it in the Remix IDE. ![Remix IDE_new_owner](./images/new_owner.png)
* Try to call setText() and get an error in MetaMask that as expected given that ownership has changed: "RPC Error: execution reverted: Caller is not the owner Object" ![RPC Error: execution reverted: Caller is not the owner Object](./images/settext_error.png)
